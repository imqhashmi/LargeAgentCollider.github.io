Joel is a senior postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford’s Department of Computer Science and a Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for New Economic Thinking. His work draws on computational statistics and machine learning to develop tools that help decision-makers reason about and experiment with complex systems using agent-based simulation models. His work through the Large Agent Collider project spans multiple topics, including simulation-based inference, differentiable agent-based modelling, causal machine learning, and synthetic data generation.

Joel completed a DPhil in computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxford’s Mathematical Institute and Institute for New Economic Thinking under the supervision of Prof. J. Doyne Farmer in 2022. During this time, he held visiting positions at The Alan Turing Institute and the University of Bristol as an Alan Turing Enrichment Student, and afterwards worked as a research scientist in the technology industry before returning to academia.
